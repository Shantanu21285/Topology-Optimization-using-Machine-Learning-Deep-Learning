# Topology Optimization Using ML-DL

## Introduction
This project focuses on topology optimization using Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques. The goal is to leverage advanced computational methods to optimize material layouts within a given design space for a set of loads and boundary conditions, enhancing performance while reducing material usage.
